**2D Motion Capture for Unity** is a python application designed to be a complement of the Unity asset, 2D Motion Capture.
This asset enables an easy construction of 2D sprite animations in Unity by a completely device-less motion capture technique,
and this application plays a role in analyzing a video file to capture the posture of a human in the video. The extraction of the 
posture from the human image is implemented using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html).
With this application, you can easily build a sophisticated animation clip for 
your Unity project without any need of special equipments, and once the animation is
generated, you can freely modify the clips the same way you deal with generic Unity animation.
